<text>Formerly the place where the early residents grazed their livestock, the Common is now the step sister to the Public Garden, having none of the swans, the disciplined flowers or the metallic ducks but still housing entertaining groups and making for a pleasant walk toward the State House and the Civil War commemorative. Read about Kosciusko before you go and stare at his statue.</text>
