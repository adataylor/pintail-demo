<text>After touring all the locations on our must do list we wound up in Boston Common and were amazed at the art exhibit "Cool Globes: Hot Ideas for a Cooler Planet". The weather was great and the leaves are changing and it was all just beautiful! Pretzel vender and Lemonade just added to the ambiance of the park and there also is a great information center and gift shop as well (good spot to get your guide book). Be aware of the homeless and transients as one tried to take my wife's backpack! All in all we felt very safe and really enjoyed the Common.</text>
