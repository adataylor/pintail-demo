red rose borders
the crazy golf woman
shuts up for the night
snow in my shoe
abandoned
white caps on the bay
a broken sign board banging
in the april wind
an aging willow
its image unsteady
in the flowing stream
just friends
he watches my gauze dress
blowing on the line
meteor shower
a gentle wave
wets our sandals
declare the causes
mankind requires
thirteen united
consent of the governed
Fortunes and our sacred Honor
